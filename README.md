Hi 👋 I'm Parisa
=======================

Senior Integration Engineer
---------------------------

I began my career in finance and accounting, but my journey took a turn when I joined a Microsoft partner as a consultant. It was there that I discovered my passion for technology and coding, particularly in backend development, where I enjoy tackling the unique challenges clients face.

Currently, I specialise in debugging and enhancing features to deliver effective solutions for our clients. My passion lies in problem solving whether it's automating processes, providing valuable insights, or streamlining workflows, I strive to make people's lives easier through technology.

I believe in continuous learning, inspired by the principles in The Pragmatic Programmer, which is why I commit to mastering a new programming language each year. I started with Java, then moved on to React, and next year, I’m excited to dive into Rust. Currently, I'm also exploring Microsoft Azure, driven by a cloud-first mentality. Additionally, I’m delving into emerging technologies like AI, including prompt engineering, vector databases, and the ethical implications surrounding them.

Ultimately, my motivation is to be at the forefront of technology, driving change and making a significant impact as a problem solver.
